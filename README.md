# AND-OR-XOR-GATES
AND, OR, and XOR gates with C#

Nothing crazy, just a intro project for people who have an assignment like this:

Chapter One Assignment:  Develop a simple program in C# that receives two binary inputs from the user (graphical or command line) and outputs the result of the selected gate operation. Gate operations that should be selectable are AND, OR, XOR.
